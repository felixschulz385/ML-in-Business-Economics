{"abstract": "\n\nWe quantify the commute time savings associated with work from home, drawing on data for 27 countries. The average daily time savings when working from home is 72 minutes in our sample. We estimate that work from home saved about two hours per week per worker in 2021 and 2022, and that it will save about one hour per week per worker after the pandemic ends. Workers allocate 40 percent of their time savings to their jobs and about 11 percent to caregiving activities. People living with children allocate more of their time savings to caregiving.\n\n", "a_d": "\nFor support in funding the Global Survey of Working Arrangements, we gratefully acknowledge the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, the Asociaci\u00f3n Mexicana de Cultura A.C., the Becker Friedman Institute at the University of Chicago, the ifo Institute, King\u2019s College London, the Smith Richardson Foundation, and the Templeton Foundation.
